## How it started 

I've been alone for a while, and I'm getting old(30+), I started feeling the urge to have a "partner in crime", AKA, feeling lonely. 
So I asked around, and people have always ask back "what kind of girl/partner are you looking for? " I hate not able to articulate what's in my mind, so I decided to write it down, since there is nothing secretive about. 

Basically, I'm looking for a girl who is just like me, holding similar values and lifestyles, I believe that's what makes a relationship successful.   

Maybe because I'm quite self-contained and happy overall, I don't want to break my inner peace. I've seen some couples holding quite different values/lifestyles, they often fight on things which is predicable, I don't want to be like that. But who knows, every couples have their own problems to solve, I might end with exactly I what I want to avoid, lol, I hope not. 

Disclaimer: No need to serious follow, this post is just a brain dump, it can only be taken as a reference. 

## Values I look for 

### Positive/optimistic
I'm an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it. 
I live by hope, as opposed to fear, anxiety, or other negative stuff. I strive to be better day to day, and I'm happy to see progress. 

It's hard for me to work/live with negative people, or people who are over-pessimistic. Even though I know sometimes their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action could be taken place, I would not enjoy whining about them. 

### Receptive / Open-minded 

I'm from China, and as much as I love American/Western culture, I can't deny that deep down I still hold a lot of value from Asian culture in general. I think ideally she is an Asian descendant or quite into Asian culture. (ps. I need to write another an article about what I see the difference Asian culture vs American culture. )

I'm quite open-minded, and I like to learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything related to productivity and self-improvement. 
Not necessarily my partner needs to like/agree with whatever I'm pursuing, but it would be great if she has similar mindset, we can learn and grow together. 

For example, in this year 2022, I've embarked on quite some explorations. I see myself would stick with them for quite some time.  
Fermentation (Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kimchi, yogurt, etc),  MBTI (personality test), and stoicism (ancient philosophy), just to name a few. I've probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I love to talk about them anytime. 

I like to learn new things and apply to my day to day life, it makes me happy. When they conflict with traditions, often I'd ditch the traditions, so ideally my partner is not very traditional.   

For example, I've been eating white rice my whole life, and I've ditched it without issue (besides dinning out). I don't eat breakfast (I do 16:8 intermittent fasting,  breakfast is not the most important meal of the day), just to new a few. 

### Supportive, feminine

My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate, etc, just some typical feminine traits I guess.  
I'm not a "male chauvinistic" person in any sense, on the contrary, I see myself as a mild feminist. I like independent souls, but strong-minded/feisty females are not my ideal choice. 


## Lifestyles I look for 

### Abstraction vs Sensing 
In MBTI's parlance, I'm a "Ni" (Introverted Intuitive) person, I'm drawn into abstraction, as opposed to tangible materials/experience. 

For example, my typical table topics are mostly related to economy, business, habit, psychology, learning, tools(software, ideas, gadgets) etc. And I often found myself despising those material, superficial, sensual stuff/experiences. For instance: fine dining, clothing, partying, "excessive cleaning" etc. 

Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, and I can surely understand. I hope my partner understands my interest as well.

### Emotion  
I'm quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I've seen many people who are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that's a big no-no to me. 

I believe in stoicism(an ancient philosophy), the overarching idea of stoicism is accepting what you can't control, and having the courage to change what you can, and the wisdom to tell the difference.  

Maintaining a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don't expect everyone, myself included, could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.

### Money 
I live quite frugal in general, I often joke about that my spending ability is like a new grad, and I'm actually proud of it. 
I came from a humble beginning, I have always lived below my means, I guess it is probably applicable to most immigrants.    

So I probably won't be happy with people who enjoy extravagant(money-wise) lifestyles. I don't mean we can't indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.  

I'm a big believer in investing, currently, I'm mostly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), and I'd gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.  

### Active 

I like all kinds of sports and workouts, I value maintaining a fit body as a foundation of health. I hope my partner would enjoy physical activity as well, and we can do something like hiking, jogging, swimming, or kayaking in our spare time. 

## Physical Appearance
I'm not a saint, I do like attractive females of course. But I care overall body shape and overall energy way more than pretty face.  

## In the end 
Here you have it, just primarily "Values" and "Lifestyles", of course, there are some other things I care about, we can go from here.
