## What' my main drive

I started jotting down my notes digitally and plain text base for a while long time, I just wanted it simple, then one work.md and day.md started bloating, naturally I divide them into separate files for different purpose, e.g. "stock-trading-record", "vim/tmux cheatsheet", "linux common commands" etc, then I've got too many files and I often ended with lots similar and overlaps files. 

Folder, file  

effortless input, efficient retrieval 


I have been using local plain text files (Markdown) + Cloud storage for years, over time, I started feeling losing control of how I manage it. There are a handful of issues. 

### Too many files 
I try to make each note file recording one thing and one thing only, so I could manage them relative easily. Over time, the root directory has got 10+ files, I realized I need to put them into different folders, I started adding more and more. E.g. `Info/cheatsheet`, `Info/cheatsheet/vim`, `info/cheatsheet/tmux`, `info/reading-thoughts`, `learn/toastmasters`, `learn/docker`, `strategy/career-roadmap`, `work/work.md` etc etc. 

These comes two issues, one is I often have hard time to choose which content should I put into which file, for example, I got some thoughts about investing psychology, should I put into `learning/investing.md` or `xxxx/psychology`, I drains my energy to decide which is the best destiny for the fleeting thought. 

Another issue is after I've got 30+ files I often forgot their existence, I ended up creating similar but duplicated/overlaps files. I tried to put all file reference in README.md and it gets back to the first issue, some files are not belong to specific folder or there are some overlaps, it makes me reluctant to organize it.   

### Hard to find my resources 

## What I'm excited about Logseq 

### Local first & non intrusive
I really appreciate Logseq doesn't mess with my local files, instead it creates its own database to reference my local files, and create tags file in its own folder, it's delicate and elegant. I can continue using Git to do source control, it makes me feel so safe, I have commits for each milestones, as long as `.git` exists, I'd not lose any content and content change history.  

I can still use Vim as main editor to write everything, and delegate Logseq to manage tagging and references. 

## No files, no folders, everything is block

No files/folders, no hustle, everything relationship management hands off to logseq(it's tags and database), that's awesome! 

search tags/blocks is way esier than files. 

## Tags and Bi-directional links 

I've always know I love tags, I loved tags in Evernote, and I hated it I can't find an easy way to have tags in Notion. Logseq makes reference tags and creating tags easy and immersive, because there is no "file", I can make tags 

the auto-completion of tags, links are amazing, I didn't know I love it so much until I use it. I have always been bothered to other files (again, files suck), but the effortless reference really connected my knowledge map.  

the reverse reference is amazing, mind opening. In a hindsight, this is what it should be for a knowledge management.   

Whenever I write a block, I give it a tag, I can see myself reference it later in future in an accumulated page, that's a very good feeling and positive feedback to push me write more. 

## Graph View, see big picture


## Go back/forward 
This is a small little feature comparing others, but I like it so much. CMD-[ / CMD-] to go back and forth the pages you've browsed, I use it 100+ times a day, it makes mindless browsing so easy. 


### Open source first, vibrant community 
I haven't really get myself involved in any open source project but as a consumer of lots of them. But I can see myself would get envolved in the future. Especially when the organizer's ideas drifting away from mine, I have the last resort to fork the source code and keep and maintain what direction I think is right. 

bonus point, the company develop & maintain the tool is a Chinese company but choosing English first and global first, I really like it and admire their spirit. 

## In the end 

I have 4 personal repos (notes, blog, Journal, English), I'm starting to merge notes and journals to one repo and see how it goes. For a long time, I questioned myself that I journal almost everyday, but I almost never looked back, it's kinda pointless, I hope by taking advantage of the bi-directional links from logseq, it would let me travel back my history moments effortlessly.
