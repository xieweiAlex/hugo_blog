### How it started  

I didn't know there is a thing called "communication styles" until I started preparing a Toastmaster speech and I took the quiz, I got 5/12 in **Supportive style**, 4/12 in **Direct style**, 2/12 in initiating, 1/12 in analytical. So Supportive and Direct are my dominant communication styles. 

It does make sense as much as I know myself, actually they're pretty much aligned with how I interact with other people in general, I'm glad that they're aligned. I'm a combination of supportive(shy, indecisive, slow, risk-averse) and Direct(confident, competitive, independent, and risk-taking). Some people might be wondering, how could these two be reconciled in one person? Well, let me explain.  


### Supportive Style 

First the supportive style, in another word as myself noticed, lacking of leadership and initiative. I'm a passionate person in general, I like to talk and engage with others in the area I'm interested in, for example, stock market, programming, psychology etc. But I rarely initialize any conversation or activity I'm passionate about, instead, I would listen to the people around me, and choose whether I should follow. I make my preference and lifestyle quite supple and diverse so I can be quite adaptive with different people, it's not easy for me to not have a good time.     

For example, these days I go to rock climbing twice a week with my roommate Eric because he is kinda passionate about it, he has been doing it since he was a teen, and he is quite good at it. I learned a lot from him, I do enjoy it, I invested a lot of time and energy in it, I can see myself doing it in foreseeable future, but I would probably won't start without him. 

I started semi-serious body building workout because then roommate Bimal was passionate about body building, he has got a quite physique, I was influenced by him, I used to go to gym with him 3 times a week while I was in Charlotte, now I moved out but kept the workout routine by myself. 

When I was working in office (before pandemic), my co-worker sitting next to me Jeremy was so passionate about playing Table Tennis, I was influenced by him, I ended up investing lots of time and energy in playing Pingpong with him. 

The list could go on and on throughout my life, I like to hang out with passionate person, and I do enjoy being a supportive follower. I do hope one day I could stand up in the limelight and be the leader/influencer and get some followers. 

<!-- The supportive style is calm, steady, approachable, and often perceived as careful, patient and amiable. --> 
<!-- In a hindsight, even though I'm not a social person, but I do enjoy occasional social activities, I always try to be positive and supportive in the communities I'm in. --> 


## Direct style

Well, there is another side of me, the "direct" me, and I often being called blunt for it. And I'm Okay with it, it's hard for me to mince words when the hard cold true is in front of my face. I am an empathetic person, it's not that I don't feel for others, but my preferred way of handling conflict/confusing/mystery is facing it head on, some people might not like it, and I probably can adjust accordingly when I notice, but that's not easy or natural for me.

For example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question which he's asked me many times, "Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?" I replied without thinking for a second: "Yes, of course it's a good time, nobody can really time the market, so anytime is a good time! And don't ask me the same question, please!" He said "Okay" and walked away, I knew he was a bit offended or disappointed, and I'm Okay with it, I wanted to let him know I don't like it. 

Yes, I literally told him "don't ask me the same question", which some people might frown upon on this "rudeness". I wasn't being rude but just direct in my own view. 

It's not hard to tell when would I being "direct", that's when things/topics fall into my passionate area, things/topics I've invested a lot.   

Sometimes I found myself very opinionated on some ideas, for example, I like CLI tools a lot, Vim is the best editor, I believe in Bitcoin, crypto and Blockchain etc. When things/ideas fall into the very limited area which I've invested a lot in, I became confident, emboldened and direct.    

### In the end 

There you have it, for things are not in my specialty or passionate area, I tend to supportive. For things I have confidence or invested heavily in, I tend to be direct.
