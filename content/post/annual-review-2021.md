## Overview  

Two years into the obnoxious pandemic, I've got so used to WFH. Though I still struggle to figure out eating every day, but I don't think we'd ever go back to office on daily basis. A brand new work/life style is opening to us, I'm so excited to see what would happen, I've always dreamed to be a [digital nomad](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-nomad.asp). 

I moved out of Bay Area in July, after staying there for 4 years, there are many happy and bitter memories, and I would probably forget them soon. I left quietly, no fuss. I will go back when I feel like to, it's not a big deal.  

I finally transferred myself into Backend job position, I think I made the right decision, I never looked back, nor open the shitty clumsy Xcode üôÖ. I could finally use my favorite Vim editor to do my job, nothing makes me happier than this.  

I spent most majority of my spare time this year in learning investing, there are so much hypes and excitement in stock & crypto market 24/7, I learned a lot. But my portfolio has been drastically underperforming S&P or QQQ index almost the whole year(peaked in Feb), it sucks! 
But I'm grateful that I got the blow early on in my investing journey, otherwise I'd be cocky and get over myself easily, the setback doesn't really damp my enthusiasm, I know I'm just starting out and I would catch up eventually. I enjoy doing it, not only for the return/result, that's the most important thing.  

I spent 1+ hour on average every day learning English on daily basis, mostly on expanding my vocabulary using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), in my [repo](https://github.com/xieweiAlex/English_Learning). I've get very comfortable with it, I used the practice 5+ years, though it's slow and I don't see it get done any time soon, but it's the best way I could figure out at this moment. 

Looking back the last year, it's very much transformative, I'm very happy about it. I settled 3 anchors for my life for the foreseeable years: Backend(Infra, security), investing(stock, crypto, Real Estate) and English(reading, speaking).  
Though I spent way too much time on stock market than anything else, way less time in BE learning-close to 0, it's a colossal mistake. At current stage of my life and foreseeable years, my primary income, social interaction, sense of safety, belongingness come from my work, and I suck at it, it agonizes me everyday.  

## Career ‚úÖ
### Vim/tmux setup for backend development 

I spent a decent amount of time setting up my dev environment in terminal, Vim & Tmux, they're awesome! I'm so glad that I committed to them while there is nobody  around me on my side, it makes me feel a bit lonely, but I have a big online community, and they're huge! I'm proud of myself for my commitment and advancement, I'm still very green in those online communities, I need to work on it. 

Post: Setup Vim as a full-fledged IDE, TBD.

### Node.js, Devops in backend getting started 
The journey of transferring into backend isn't easy, especially I'm in platform team which mainly on Infra & security, it's very challenging. There are tons of stuff I need to learn, and I need to learn on the go, I got lost all the time. I appreciate my company and my manager and my teammates gave me the chance to learn, the impostor syndrome haunts me every work day. I'm sure I would get better next year.  

Post: 1 year into Backend, TBD 

## Learning ‚úÖ  
### Vim
Learning Vim is a life long journey, the more I learn the more I feel I'm just getting started. I finished another book "Mastering Vim quickly", it's quite easy for me to read, I learn most of those tricks & concepts here and there in internet over the years. 

Post: I use Vim everywhere, TBD 

### Stock market psychology, Options basics 
Finished most part of Meetkevin's "stock & psychology of money" course, Investopedia's stock option basics, and I spent huge amount of time reading Motley Fool and Investopedia's newsletter. Watched ÁæéÊäïÂêõ almost all the video on Youtube. 
I like them so much from bottom of my heart, I like to be in the market, I like to trade/bet base on my knowledge, looking at the world/society through investor's lens makes me feel so good. I feel I'm more engaged in the society and economy.

Post: 1 year into stock market, TBD 

### English (Reading, speaking, writing)  
I'm an old hand learning English, I'm fully convinced that vocabulary is my primary roadblock for blending into American society and my career advancement. I read/memorize those words every morning, night, weekend or whenever I got some free time.  
Almost a decade ago I found Eudic, I have been a happy customer ever since. This year I found Anki, it's pretty awesome and it's got huge extensibility and vibrant community, I'm sparing some of job from Eudic to Anki. 
 
Post: Repeating 20 times for every new word, TBD 

## Health ‚úÖ 

### Neck issue  
My neck pain still bothers me every now and then, whenever I got stressed out on desk, I'd fall into bad posture and be paralyzed the next day. Hope I could get over it.   

Post: How I conquer my stiff neck problem, TBD 

### workout 
I do home workout most of time these days, mainly push up and pull resistance bands, I use Reventure balance board to do indoor balance practice when I can not go out stating. 

I found this thing called "Contrast shower", it's very interesting, it's so easy, fun and fulfilling. I feel so much energetic/refreshed coming out of shower room every time, I'm glad I find another practice I can do in my lifetime. 

## Life / Relationship ‚ùì
### Life ü§î
N/A

### Dating 
I finally started dating after being single for years, it's still weird to me spending too much time with somebody but my computer.  

### Friends/family 
N/A

<!-- ## Regret ‚ùå -->
<!-- ###  Early up --> 
<!-- The first line of most my daily journals are usually I overslept this morning, I start my day with self-resentment almost every day, that's so bad. I know if I could get up early, my day would be way more organized and productive, and I've been struggling with it for more than a decade, I still haven't given up. I will conquer it, I will set it as my primary goal for 2022. -->  

<!-- ### Outputting --> 
<!-- I'm tired of being a consumer and being invisible, I'd really want to have some social influences. The idea has haunted for a few years since I was getting 30, now I really need to get it started, and I'd like to start with good old fashioned way, blogging! -->
