## Why don't they panic 

Recently with the CoronaVirus tension ramps up, I started thinking about buy some face masks just in case, but both offline shops and online retailers all out of stock. Shit, I've seen numerous news about those Chinese guys  


### They have the basic trust in Government and news media 
It' quite ironic people in China they trust and rely on government so much, but every time any dire situation happens, they got in panic very fast and started looking all kinds of rumors. I think at bottom of their heart, they know how government works, they know their dear gov might sacrifice some one but just don't know who will be, they can't blindly depend on them. They'd better prepare something for themselves, looking for grapevines in case gov won't disclose truth, stocking up for family in case shops can't meet the supply.   

On the contrary, Americans always criticizing the gov, they always saying the gov is not worth truasting, the gov is very inefficient, the news media all full of fake news. But as the situation getting worse, I don't see the normal Americans panic, they live their life as normal, even though gov and news media keep escalating the warnings, nobody can force them putting masks on their face.   

### They have strong mind  
There is no doubt in general Western people have stronger mind comparing with Asians. As people feel strong and value the independence, they are just not easy to get panic. As stereotype shows, most Asian have weak ego, submissive personality, like sheeps are easy to get panic and lost their mind.   

### They didn't experience that many hard-times as we do 
Maybe because of history experience, special my parents' generation, they have been through many artificial difficulties (disasters), so many of their fellow have been sacrificed, or their social positions been through roller coasters. Like people have been bite by a snake, they would be much easier get scared by ropes.   

In America, people's life style has been constant for decades, they have the fundamental trust in their society.
