All of a sudden everybody on WeChat started sharing their life moment of the same day 4 years ago, then I realized today is the leap day for every 4 years. I started thinking what's my life like 4 years ago, skimming my social media(mainly Wechat), and got some memory splinters.  

### I lost my luggage in Yueyang 

I was in Shenzhen, just a few weeks back from my hometown Yueyang where I lost my luggage in a cab. I was very disappointed üò©, I never thought someone would seriously take my luggage and don't return back. I even didn't lock it (I still don't have the habit of locking luggage). I didn't take the receipt from driver. I made numerous calls to the taxi coordination center, broadcasted the bounty from 200 RMB to 4000 RMB. I knew there are so many security cameras on the road on traffic lights, I knew the very precise time I passed those traffic lights, so as long as we can access the security camera footage we should be able to find the taxi and get some information. That was the first time in my lifetime seeking help from the local government, and I was super upset about all the local government branches' sluggishness and irresponsibility. I ended up visiting 7 or 8 branches in my small town and none of them gave a damn of my lost, those people were so arrogant and unprofessional as shit. I always knew how corrupt and irresponsible the local government department is, and that time I was crushed.

In a hindsight, if I booked a Didi or Uber that night which was surging at that time, it would be a different story since I could've all the taxi info in my phone. As a self-professed tech enthusiast who always embracing technology and the digital revolution, I made bad choice at that time.

### Working life

As my work, I was very happy working in Jpush at that time, a new manager came to our team 1 month ago and we got along very well. I was living/working with a few bachelor colleagues 24/7. We were always staying very late in office because we got nowhere to go besides the office, that was a simple happy bachelor period. Before long, I didn't expect things could change so dramatically, I had to leave JPush abruptly and unwillingly. I had a good time there, I made many friends there (Though most of them we're not in track any more). Communication and the ability to speak out inside group is always a key issue for a good relationship, I learned it a hard way. If anyone thinks I'm good at communication, I started learning from that. üòº

### Preparing study abroad 

In the meantime, I was preparing for studying abroad in the US. I've always wanted to get outside of China to checkout the world. I failed the application 1 year ago, it was the second time trying and I had no clue what would happen. I vividly remember the recruiting staff from the school I'll be in gave me a call and started the conversation with ‚ÄúHow are you doing today?", I got lost at that very moment, all I knew for the conversation starter was when people say ‚ÄúHow are you‚Äù, you can response ‚ÄúI'm fine, thank you!". I spent a few minutes stuttering out some phrases about what I did that day üòÖ. 

My English was so bad, that was a hard time, I'm very glad I've gone through this far. I can't believe coming to the US and lived here since then was the first time I went out of China (Besides Taiwan actually, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø, Taiwan is special). There was no accident, no surprise for my visiting, I had no relative and no friend living in the US (I did have one in the school which is AJie), it has been 4 years since then. Coming to the US is one of the best choice I deliberately made myself in my lifetime, I'm very proud of that.

### Bitcoin 
As Bitcoin, right before I decided to come to the US, I sold all my holdings for Bitcoin/Litecoin. At that time, Bitcoin has been staying low and sideway prices around $500 - $700 for 3 years. I had enough patience at that time since I was about to start a new journey. I choice to reduce my uncertainties even though I was never short on money. I lost more than half of my invest in Bitcoin, I didn't expect that Bitcoin soared 10+ times just 1 year later. Ironically, now the Bitcoin price is around 20 times comparing then, and I'm gonna jump on it again. Of course, I'm not gonna put all my stakes on it, but since the production halving is about to happen in 2 months and the global stock market is stumbling, I don't see any other good alternative investment choice to go.

That's all I can recall for this date 4 years ago after reviewing my Wechat Moment for almost 1 hour, I hope that I could have some more pleasant memories next time around. Stay tuned. ‚úä
