## The "No disturb mode" shortcut is a game changer   

> Pro user don't care about Good User Experience  

As a self-professed pro user, I've been despising good UI/UX for years, I thought as long as it can its job well, it brings convenience or productivity, it doesn't need (sometimes it just can't) be very simple, straightforward or intuitive. 

I've always known the feature "No disturb mode" in Mac which lots of people don't know, it's very nice feature, one click to stop all the notification from bothering. I guess lots of people are kind of sick of the non-stop notifications coming every few minutes even seconds (Specially some notifications are default to alert instead of preview, it would hover there forever which is super annoying, that's a another story), 

Don't get me wrong, the notifications are very necessary, we want keep ourselves informed. I knew there is a notification center centralize all notifications, we can check them any time. There is a "no disturb" toggle we can turn on, so there is no notification popping out any more, they all end up collecting in notification center anyway which is nice. But my notification center always end up thousands of feeds which I never checked regularly, it keeps overrun all the time, I never really read any of them, just blindly delete all. 

Why it ends like this? I only found it out when I explored the [shortcut of "no disturb mode"](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-do-not-disturb-mchl999b7c1a/mac), just `Press and hold the Option key while you click the Notification Center icon in the menu bar`, that's fantastic easy. Then I realize how the redundant steps stopped me from clicking the toggle, click the menu icon and wait the animation of notification swiping out, then move to the toggle and click and swept it out, it doesn't look very complicate, but it do require some context change, some move around, the animation I'd say even worse the experience tho it only takes less than 1 second.   

Then I started using the notification center because `opt in` the `no disturb mode` which makes me not able to receive any pop up notification. I had to check the center to know what's going on, after I checked, I would clean them conveniently. The problem solved and the new habit customized.

It reminds why we need a **Killer feature** to migrate habit, because the migration expense is big, but the ground work is needed to
