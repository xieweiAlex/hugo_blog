### It's hard 
I didn't know playing skateboard is that hard until I tried to learn it seriously. I spent couple of months during COVID learning Ollie alone, and I still haven't master it. Ollie is just a starting trick for skateboarding, I got a long way to go. I was very confidence to start since I played roller blade for years which should give me a good balance, which should make my jumpstart easier, I underestimated it.   

There are countless tricks for skateboarding, I can see myself playing it next 5 years and still get a long way to go, I won't feel bored, to say the least, this makes excited.  

As I'm getting old, when I try to do something seriously, I hope to do it in a long term, I can take my time, enjoy the journey and accompany. 

### It's dangerous & inspiring  

One part I like skateboarding because it's kinda dangerous, you can get your body scratched, your ankle, legs broken for a bad luck, easier. It's not for a faint of heart. There are numerous skateboard tricks circulating in internet, which are too bold, some people might despise their boldness, some might get aspired, I'm the latter. I don't see myself can master those tricks anytime soon, but even just imaging one day I could do that already makes me excited. 

The stereotype of people playing skateboard usually are cantankerous, tameless, they often fuel my energy and makes me excited. 

### It's convenient  

I loved playing basketball when I was a teenage, it's convenient, sophisticated and fun. But after I stopped growing height, and being moderately short in height is in such a disadvantage position in the basketball court, I'm very unhappy about it. I know that's not anybody's fault, I just opted out.

Recently there is a fad that lots of people fascinating into skiing or snowboarding, I've always liked those balance required sport, especially snowboarding, it looks cool and I can play some tricks with it. I went to play a couple of times, and I found out it's not very good for me to take it seriously. 

In most of area you can only play snowboard couple of months in a year, all base on the lenient of weather. Usually you have to drive couple of hours to the snow field, since it is not convenient to get there, people usually play many hours non stop from mountain top to bottom, I usually get bored playing 1 or 2 hours. 

To me, playing snowboarding is more like a social sport, a group of people hitting there and play together is a typical theme. As I'm not a social person(I'm not anti-social in any means), one of the reason I loved basketball is I can play myself all alone and enjoy it, which you just can't do it in football, pingpong or tennis. I would expect the sports (or anything) I like, I spent most of time I'm progressing myself alone, and some occasional chances we hit up some friends sparking ideas together.      

One thing I like about skateboard is it doesn't require anything besides a board and willing. You can play in most of place you want, there isn't much cost or maintenance(I've been tormenting my board for over a year, the maintenance is $0).
