## How it started 

I believe in Bitcoin, there is no question about it. I preach it all the time (I'm a preachy person I guess ðŸ˜¸), I got asked very often the same questions over and over again, I figured I'd better write down an curated page for the research I've collected.  


## Value

### It's backed by nothing 

## It's not an inflation hedge 

## Nobody uses it as a medium of exchange

## What's the value proposition  

## Safety

## It could be banned 

## It's risky  

## I don't want to self-custody 

## What do I like it personally 

* Pioneer, asymmetric risk award. 
* It speaks about truth, money and the monetary system
