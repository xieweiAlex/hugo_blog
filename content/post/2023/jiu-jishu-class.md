## How it started 

I've heard Jiu jishu million times from people I follow like Lex Fridman, Joe Rogan, and the Stoicism meeting organizer Eric, my colleague Oakley etc, I've been fascinated by the practicality of this martial art. 

Just another day, I saw they advertised the Jiu jishu class right inside of the gym I'm with, it only cost $100 per month, what I can I lose by that, so I signed up.   

## What went wrong 
So I went to class, I was very excited to this brandnew world unfolding to me, I imagined myself showing off some tricks to my friends sometime. 

But I was quite lost in the class, because that's a more family-oriented local small class, most of them are regulars, I was the only newbie there, I had no idea how to even start, I felt so awkward. People there were very friendly and helpful, just I have close to 0 knowledge about Jiu jishu. I found myself dreaded to going to the class each time, I wanted to learn from Youtube on my own, but I didn't mange to do it, and I can only practice the skills with real people since it mainly focus on grappling skills, it's very hard to practice on my own--I'm not a fan of this. 

I still have lots of things to do on daily basis, as I'm clearly aware that my productive time is very limited everyday, part because of efficiency on working and my wide-range of interest. 

especially Harry and "Eraf?"--They two were so warm and constantly approach me with care and comforting, they were so warm 


Of course that's a perfect opportunity to learn, but that's just too much for a mid-age man like me. I have to confess, I'm getting old, I constantly feel the time constraint everyday, I have so many things want to do that I have been pushing forever(including writing blog posts).
