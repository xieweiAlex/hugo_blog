Age has been just a number for me after my 20s, I don't usually do birthday at all. It doesn't bring me maturity, intelligence,fulfillment or any kind I care. I've seen many people with adult age but very childish temperament/cognition. But while my age was approaching 30, I consciously and unconsciously feel the pressure from myself, or more specifically, my dreamed of the successful myself. I wanted to be success, I dreamed a lot of things could happen to me while I'm 30, some of them has done, a lots have lot which worth doing a wrap up.   

## What I have changed for good 
### I became confident 
I started being aware of the world since I got out of high school, I was very much lost in the college because I didn't like the major I was in. I made the best choice changing my career to Computer Science right before I got out of college. 

I'm confident what I'm doing it beneficial to the society, and I'm a good programmer (even though I can't prove myself at this moment), I'm a good person who worth being friend, I will have pretty bright future regarding career and family. 

### I'm genuinely more happy 
I'm very much emotionally stable in my own standard, I rarely get mad or confused, or frustrated in general, because over the years I've learned how the society, business, human psychology works in a fundamental level, I still have a long way to go for sure, but my values have basic shaped. I like this kind of myself and I'm proud of it.  

I'm genuinely more happy when I clearly know what do I like or not, so I can say No very lighthearted and firmly to those things I don't give a shit about. For example, Chinese herbal medicine or some nonsense Chinese traditions. I don't care how other people care about those nonsense at all.   

## What I'm looking for 
### Settling down 

I like the IT industry in general, I've the passion on programming, I'm pretty sure I will keep coding in my whole life time, why not? It's easy, powerful and ubiquitous. There is just one thing has bugged me for years since I started out, I'd like to do more logic based programming instead UI oriented, I'm glad brought out and still being determined, 

In personal life, I've roamed around constantly over the years, I hope I could settle down somewhere.  

### Give back to the world 

## Conclusion 

### I made peace with myself

I'm genuinely happier then I was 20+ because I've got much more assurance what do I want and how the society works. 

I lived a handful of cities in my 20+(Beijing, Yueyang Hunan, Shenzhen, Fairfield Iowa and the Bay Area), I make some friends in every places I live. I've got to know myself very well I'd say, I've known very well of my shortcomings and edges. 🙂


### Life is short, I feel the urgency  

I become nicer and more patient in general which I can tell myself because I'm more easy to say No either to myself or others base on my own choices. Life choices are abundant but I've got limited time and focus, and I've got to know how the society works, how people relationship works most of time, I became more determined and bold most of time, I feel good. I feel the urgency and pressure when I know what I need to do to make the most of my life, I enjoy the struggling process which I prioritized for myself.  

Then those things not in my priority list, I'm very happy to let them go and delegate to others if possible. I live my life, and I know what do I want. ✊  


I'm genuinely happy everyday, I've got a relative good life, and my life would become better. 

### I've learned enough, I'm looking forward to giving back
I constantly feel I'd like to be leader, because as an individual contributor the things I can do is so limited, since my time is limited, I can't way that long. I'd like to leverage my knowledge/influence, take more responsibility, make things happen in a larger scale.   

> Some people show their appreciation to the society by producing some product which is beautiful. 

I've been a sucker a really long time and I'm shame of it. I've always absorbing from the society, people around me, I think it's high time to give back. 

As for the society, I'd like to make something good/nice/cool. I strongly touched the phrase Steve Jobs demoed in the presentation 

I really hope I could find a hill to die on, I'd like to burn myself in it, embody myself into the product, my knowledge, my values, my appreciation to the world.   

As for people around me, I'd like to be an influencer, I'd like to be a mentor if I could. 

### Settling down  
I've been moving around a handful of industries and cities since I left college which was full of random and lacked of direction, I've been constantly saying goodbye for a lot of things, I thought I was cool and strong (not tied by anything), now I feel a little bit sad about it. I'm starting become old, things overdue need to be addressed. There is an old saying Chinese which I started feeling so wise. 

> 有恒产者有恒心 which translate to English is "Who has stabled investment would have constant determination"
> shall have his peace of mind when he possesses a piece of land.   

Now I'm little bit tired of wandering life. I'd like to find a place I could settle down, build a solid friend circle which could last long.
