### The meaning of social
I have never been a social person, but I do join a lots of meetups both online and off line. I.e. Bitcoin, MBTI, Stoicism, Chinese language exchange, Cloud Native in Dallas, etc. I like to hangout with people with similar interest, but I rarely hangout with people personally, i.e. go out for a lunch or something, I see that as a sign of superfacial relationship. I guess it's because we all live very far away, and most of time I only hangout with people live close to me for non thematic events.       

I have never been a very social person, but I do enjoy attending various meetups both online and offline. Some of my favorites include Bitcoin, MBTI, Stoicism, Chinese language exchange, and Cloud Native in Dallas. I find it fulfilling to connect with others who share similar interests, but I rarely hang out with people on a personal level. To me, that type of relationship can feel superficial. Additionally, many of the people I meet through these meetups live far away, so it's rare for me to hang out with them outside of the events. 

I think I should be more proactive with this, I could either make some inquiries or organize events to catch up with people I got to know and interest to be friends with.

### Active vs passive learning 
I have been reading the book "Poor Charlie's Almanac" this month, thanks MoneyXYZ online book club, otherwise I would not have the motivation to read so dilligently. 

I realized this term called "Active vs Passive learning", when we listen to podcast or watch Youtube video, it's very relaxing and the people on the other side lead us through the thinking journey, but it's very inefficient, as learning for different people are very different. For some people some concepts need to pause and think, maybe reference other resource, take notes and get back and forth. You can argue most of media content we consume on-demand, we can pause and rewind back, but to be honest, I don't think most people most majority of time does it. But while we're reading, we do it all the time. 

Besides that, reading often involves skimming and reviewing, Readwise is a great service that use spaced repetition to remind and rekindle my thoughts in highlights. I should've thought about this way earlier, I should have spent more time on reading and less time on Youtube and Podcast.
