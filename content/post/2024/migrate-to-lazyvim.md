[how it started](#How-it-started )

## How it started 
Using Vim for 10 years. 
craftmanship

Vim and Neovim separation.  


### How do I like it 
Nice interactive interface. 
ecosystem, hand free, community suggested pkgs.

### What I don't like 
It's a bit clunky and slow
Lots of time deciding whether I should adapt "community guidance"


## In the end
