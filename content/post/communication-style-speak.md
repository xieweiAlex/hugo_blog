### Intro 

Hello fellow Toastmasters, today we're gonna talk about "Communication styles." I didn't know there is a thing called "communication styles" until I started preparing this speech and took the quiz, they are 4 styles in total, they are "supportive", "direct", "initiative", "analytical". After took the quiz, I got to know my two dominant styles are supportive and direct. I loved it, I do think it makes sense as much as I know myself. Some people might be wondering, isn't these two contradicting with each other? Well, let me explain. 


### Supportive Style 
<!-- The supportive style is calm, steady, approachable, and often perceived as careful, patient and amiable. --> 

<!-- Another example could be our most popular outdoor activity, hiking. I naturally don't have a good sense of direction, so I incline to rely on others whenever I'm with other people, I don't pretend to know anything, I don't feel ashamed as well, just to be a good supporting follower. I follow anybody who leads, whether I know them or not, they probably have better sense of direction than me ðŸ˜„. --> 


First, the supportive style, there is an example: few weeks ago a sunny Wednesday after work, I went to indoor rock climbing with my roommate Eric, it was fun and we had a good time there, we met a friend Jason he proposed that we go out for a quick bite after this intense workout. 

That sounds like a great idea, but I was and still now practicing 16:8 intermittent fasting, which I'm not supposed to eat after 8 pm, at that moment it was already 8 pm. I hesitated for a second, and I told myself that rules are supposed to be broken on occasion, it should not be a big deal. So I responded "Yes, let's do it!" 

Then there comes next question, "what kind of food should we go?" I said I like Ramen, or there is a Chipotle closeby as well. But they were like "Nah." Jason proposed "How about chick-fil-A? It's just across the street." Eric was pretty much onboard with that. But it really puts me off, the last thing I want is deep fried fast food. But within seconds, I talked over myself: "we just had an intense workout, it should've killed tons of calorie, it should be alright." Then we went there and it was delicious.   

In a hindsight, it not uncommon for me to "wrest my arms" in order to fit in, not only communication but interaction with people in general.  



## Direct style

Well, there is another side of me, the "Direct" me, I sometimes being called blunt for that. For example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question, which he has asked me many times, "is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?" I replied without thinking for a second "Yes, this is a good time, nobody can really time the market, so any time is a good time. And don't ask me the same question." He said "Okay" and then walked away, I knew he probably doesn't like the answer, and he might be offended a bit. And I'm Okay with it. 

Yes, I literally told him "don't ask me the same question" in front of his face, some people might frown upon this kind of "rudeness". Of course I didn't mean to hurt him in any regard, and I'm also not a financial pro as well, I was just expressing what's really in my mind.

I know many people have problem saying NO in front of others, I'm the same when I'm being the "supportive style". But when topics fall into what I have confidence in or I'm passionate about, I become a "Direct" me. Topics like crypto, stock market, programming, productive tools/hacks etc.  


### In the end  
Here you have it, fellow Toastmasters, that's my two dominant communication styles, supportive and direct. How do you like it, what's your communication style, let me know and we can discuss about it offline.
