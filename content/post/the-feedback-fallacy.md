## Review of the article "The Feedback Fallacy"

Recently I read the article [The Feedback Fallacy](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy), I was amazed, I've thought it for a long time, as I was born and raised in a traditional Asian culture which encourage submission and patriarchy, I have a weak ego and incline to follow others whenever possible. But since I left my hometown and living alone metro cities for years, I found myself became more self-center, independent, and most importantly, happier. I know what I'm doing, I know what I want and I'm doing my own best in the present, I tend to take rejection more relax, I only worry about letting myself down and lose my hope. 

### The Source of Truth
> The first problem with feedback is that humans are unreliable raters of other humans. Over the past 40 years psychometricians have shown in study after study that people don’t have the objectivity to hold in their heads a stable definition of an abstract quality, such as business acumen or assertiveness, and then accurately evaluate someone else on it. Our evaluations are deeply colored by our own understanding of what we’re rating others on, our own sense of what good looks like for a particular competency, our harshness or leniency as raters, and our own inherent and unconscious biases


> We’re often told that the key to learning is to get out of our comfort zones, but these findings contradict that particular chestnut: Take us very far out of our comfort zones, and our brains stop paying attention to anything other than surviving the experience. It’s clear that we learn most in our comfort zones, because that’s where our neural pathways are most concentrated. It’s where we’re most open to possibility, most creative, insightful, and productive
