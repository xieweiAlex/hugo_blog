## Career 

I didn't do much for my career steering ðŸ˜©.

### Bash 


## Health 
### Neck stiffness  
The neck stiffness seems under recovering, I don't be obviously bothered by the pain everyday, but I still get it once every few days.

I've tried lots of ways conquering it, I bought the latex topping, I use the massage gun on daily basis, I use toning ball to stretch the neck everyday, I'm not sure which one of the combination really does the job. Anyway, I will keep doing that until I can't feel it for months.  

### Stomach illness  
I haven't been attacked by the stomach illness for months since I started taking probiotic pill regularly, I guess it has gone. ðŸ˜º  


## Self growth 
### English 
I still spent most of spare time remembering English words. I'm glad I reached the goal of 55% of "Friends" words. Besides that, I've got the routine writing down the words/phrase I met everyday, I'm very proud of it.     

### Toastmasters 
I joined the regular toast masters meeting every Wednesday afternoon, though I setup goal to give at least two speech but I ended up giving 0, it's hard.  

### Reading 
I regret I spent too less time reading book, the Principle I was suppose to finish reading this month, I ended up finishing 1/5 of it. I should spend more time on it. 

### Relationship  

### Find my community  
I got no progress on it, in order to know more people have common interest, I think I need to start a project and work towards it together. Since the pandemic constrained all of us at home, it's hard to get into new activity.   

### Know more girls 
No progress on it either. 

### Sports & Entertainment  
### Skateboard 
I've got into two tricks, Ollie and Shoving. I'm definitely haven't got enough progress which I can show off or brag about, I'm still on the way. 

### TV show (Westworld)

I've become more and more unhappy about this show, I can tell the quality of show is decreasing since Season 2, but I'm still hesitant to put it off. 

### Video recording & editing 

I spent hours editing my recorded videos from iPhone to Mac, I enjoyed it, it was fun, but it was complicated. I should've learn from Youtube tutorial at the very beginning. 

## Initiative 
### Early up 
Getting up early in April was totally a failure which is the cause for lots of my other goals. 

### Blockchain course from Coursera
