## How it started 

I've been alone for a while, and I'm getting old(30+), I started feeling the urgency to get a partner in crime. So I asked around, people always ask back "what kind of girl are you looking for? " I hate not able to articulate that well, so I decided to write it down, since there is nothing secret about it. 

Basically I'm looking for a girl who is just like me, sound quite narcissistic, but that's my genuine feeling. Maybe because I'm quite self-contained and happy, I don't really want to break it, and I've seen some couples hold quite different values / lifestyles, and living together unhappy, I don't want to be like that. 

Of course people are different, something is easy for me might be difficult for another person. I can take compromise, I just dump them all out of my mind, we can treat them as reference, not rules. 

## Values I look for 

### Positive / optimistic
I'm an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it. I live by hope, as opposite to not fear, stress or other stuff. I'm happy to see progress or improvement, that's the main driver for my day to day life. 

It's hard for me to work / live with negative / pessimistic person, even though I know sometimes I know their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action taken place, I'd not enjoy whining about them. 

This is not to see we don't complain or try to solve problem, people around me probably know I'm quite critical on lots of things, and I see it as a tough love, and hoping to change.    


### Receptive / Open-minded 

I'm from China, as much as I love American/Western culture, I can't deny that deep down I'm still a Chinese. I think ideally she is Asian descendant or into Asian culture.   

I'm quite open-minded, and I enjoy learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything contributes my self-improvement. 

For example, in this year 2022, I've embarked fermentation journey(Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kamichi, yogurt etc), learning MBTI and stoicism, just to name a few, and I've probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I'd be thrilled to talk about them anytime. 

Not necessary my partner needs to like/agree whatever I'm pursuing, but I hope to see she has similar mindset, ideally we can learn and grow together. 


### Supportive, feminine

My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate etc, just some common feminine traits I guess.  
I'm not a "male chauvinistic" person, on the contrary, I see myself as a moderate feminist. I like independent people, but strong-minded/feisty female would not my ideal choice. 


## Lifestyles I look for 

### Abstraction vs Sensing 
In MBTI parlance, I'm a "Ni" (Introverted Intuitive) person, I'm drawn into abstraction(not tangible materials/experience). 

For example, my common table topics are economy, business, power, psychology, tools(software, ideas, little gadgets) etc, and I often found myself despise those material, superficial, sensual stuff / experience. For example, fine dining, clothing, "excessive cleaning" etc. 

Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, I can understand it. And I hope my partner understand it as well.

### Emotion  
I'm quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I've seen many people are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that's a big problem to me. 

I believe in stoicism, the very essence idea is accepting what you can't control and having the courage to change what you can, and having the wisdom to tell the difference.  

Maintain a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don't expect everyone, me included could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.

### Money 
I live quite modestly overall, I often joke about that my spending ability is like a new grad, and I'm actually proud of it. I came from a humble beginning, I have always been living below my means, I guess it probably applicable for most immigrants.    

So I probably won't be happy with people enjoy luxurious (money-wise) lifestyle. I don't mean we can't indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.  

I'm a big believer in investing, currently I'm mainly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), I'd gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.  

### Active 

I like all kinds of sports and workout, I enjoy maintaining a fit body. I hope my partner would enjoy physical active as well, and we can do something like hiking, kayaking in spare time. 

## In the end 
There you have it, just primarily "Values" and "Lifestyles", of course there are lots of others things I care, but above are just things top off my mind.
