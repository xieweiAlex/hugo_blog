## I love my work 

I always heard people saying "work life balance", as a bachelor, I don't have much personal life, it's hard for me separate work and life. I heard Jeff Bezos says "Work life harmony", yes, I'm totally down with that.  

### I got paid constantly with considerable salary 
It's hard to deny nowadays programmers got paid very generously comparing other professions, the market is booming, lots of opportunities available all the time, it's a good time. The whole society is moving digitalization and we are just started, i know there are would be even more opportunities in the perceivable future, I'm moving the same directino with the world. I know I'm making positive contribution to the world, I feel safe.   

### It's good for my career growth 
Work environment is my backyard playground where I can play, I got all the good office supplies, product design, UI/UX resources, they're all there support my play, how can i don't feel grateful. I can image myself start my own project which these support (maybe I should find one). I like to work with others, I always learning from people around me. With decent big enough project, I got the chance to play, to meet a problem and solve it with others' support and praise, it's so much fun.    

Specially I'm committed to programming, I know I won't be out of programming for the near future, all I'm doing is building a good foundation for myself. I image myself being a technical architect and tell others all your struggles or hardwork I've met when I was young, I went though it, I have good knowledge and experience to be a mentor when I want to be.  

Working in a company helps me understand how a business works in the society, I know I will start my own business someday. It's fascinating to build a product the whole society likes it, build a team which everybody is having fun during work, allure people like my working together and build the future.  

### It helps build myself 
I always learning from people around me, but I need a project work on (A battle to fight), I really enjoy working with people I admire and a project is rewarding, the process keeps teaching me how to do things, how the world or society works.  

I can't deny I got so much influence from my daily work to my life, maybe because I don't have much personal life for now, but I enjoy it. I committed to the IT revolution. I feel like I got rebuild from work constantly, I always feel I might become a robot in the future, of course I don't want to, but I'm interested to see how it goes.
