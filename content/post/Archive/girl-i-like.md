## Girl I like in the first sight  

There are some kind of girls I know I'd love to get in touch if possible in the first sight, what are those characters attract me? Let me clean my thought by write it down. 

### docile & diffidence  
I first heard this two words phrase from the [Video](Youtube.com), that's the common stereotype of Japanese girls which lots of people like, yeah, shame to say, I'm one of them. I think most probably I grew in a traditional confucian culture, it emphasis stabilization of family as the smallest unit of society is the essence of a good society, and female usually act as a assistant in the family which male adult is the leader. I'm very used to it. I do admire the strong ego of modern women, but maybe just because my ego is relative weak, I just feel I'm not able to work with that out.

I'm just a traditional Asian adult who hopes I could be the cornerstone of the family(Yeah, in Asian culture, getting married and have children is a must, not an option), my partner would be better admire me, assist me.  

Men usually acts as hard-edged character, but female act malleable other side. I really like girls have the malleable personality.   

### Sweet smile & love life   
The same as majority male adult, I like girls have sweet smile and act sweet all the time if possible. 

I like girls who can make life delicate and exquisite. I like those people who try to improve life quality all the time, understand the unspoken rules of life, get along with it that attracts me.  

### Empathy 
I like girls who have strong empathy, she can understand the subtle feelings, she will be touched easily and comfort others when necessary. 


After I wrote this down, I feel my expectations are typically old fashion Asian male way, which is a shame I always profess myself as a progress liberal. 

It's funny I myself know myself in the bottom of my heart I naturally have those characters, in many years, I feel like my personality is like a girl, I'd definitely willing the date a girl has a copy of my personality. But over the years striving in the society, I got over it, I changed quit a bit on the surface.  

## What are those characters put me off? 

### Being aggressive 
Working or living with girls with aggressive personality really put me off, I had few experience, I got lost. But with male on the same situation, I don't that mind, I enjoyed challenge authority and being challenged by others as well, I know this sounds sexism, but it's just another old fashion Asian way.    

### anti-intellectual
