# I'm bummed out the dating difficulty in Bay Area 

Since I passed the age of 30 I started looking for some sense of settling down. I'd like to have a girl with me, I've had enough solitude.  

I knew being an Asian man dating in America is in disadvantage, special I live in the Bay Area here has a huge gender ratio difference, it's like a double whammy. 

I got in the online dating market with a low expectation, I tried numerous Apps like "Coffee meet Bagel", "East meet East", "Hinge", "Facebook Dating", I sent numerous likes out but received close to 0
